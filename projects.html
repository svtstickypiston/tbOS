            <h3>Responsible AI in Music</h3>
            <p>
                For my dissertation in my final year of university, I took part as a researcher on the Responsible AI in Music initiative. This involved designing a Delphi study to identify key responsible features for music AI systems, as well as developing a website and simulating the running of the study using Google Gemini API on Python. Since graduating I have continued work on the initiative, such as writing supporting documents for the benefit of survey participants. I am to feature as a co-author on the upcoming publication for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project, I have gained skills and experience for conducting research, including designing and distributing surveys, analysing results and protecting participant information for safe use. I have also proven personal project management skills as well as my ability to work as part of a wider project environment, and gained experience using AI APIs such as Google Gemini API, as well as HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Python for web development.
