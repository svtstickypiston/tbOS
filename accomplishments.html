        <h2>Computer Science Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>
			In 2025 I achieved a first class degree in Computer Science with Software Development at the University of Liverpool. This has given me all the skills for a career in software development, such as a thorough understanding of a wide variety of programming languages, and a keen problem-solving attitude to computing.

            I have been heavily involved in the Responsible AI in Music initiative being undertaken by Dr. Jacopo de Berardinis at the University of Liverpool. This project combines some of my biggest interests - music, AI, and ethics! I have enjoyed helping to coordinate the research, and have gained a wide range of skills related to running research projects as a result.
        </p>

            I also have several other qualifications such as an RYA Dinghy Instructor qualification, Powerboating Level 2, and a UK driving license.
