        <h2>Musical Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I play guitar, piano and trombone, and love to get involved in bands and music groups!
        </p>
        <p>
            In August 2024 I briefly worked at YMCA as Music Skill Clinic Leader, where I taught groups of up to 10 children how to play and perform on a range of instruments such as guitar, ukelele and keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>During my final year of university I was ensemble leader of Liverpool University Big Band, where I organised our first (ever??) trip outside of Liverpool, when we visited our friends the Arrhythmics from Leeds! I had a fantastic time playing with and running LUBB, and will certainly be returning to a big band soon...</p>
